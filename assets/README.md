# Switching-from-Div-to-Semantic-tags
homework switching from Div to Semantic tags, the original code was setup using Div tags.  My teacher has assigned me with changing the div tags in the html with Semantic tags while maintaining the orignal functionality of the website.  It is done when the HTML no longer has any Div tags and appears the same as before while maintaining its original functionality.
